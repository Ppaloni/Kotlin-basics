/*Create a class called Shape inside the 
com.viope.app package. The shape class has primary 
constructor and two integer properties: xPos and yPos.
The intial values of the both properties is zero. 
The class have also one member function called print() 
that prints the position.

Create ShapeApp file that contains the main function 
that creates one object from the Shape class and 
prints its position. */

//My Solution

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  // Create an object
  var shp = Shape()
  shp.print()
}

class Shape() {
  // Class properties
  private var xPos: Int = 0
  private var yPos: Int = 0


  
  fun print() {
    println("Position: x=$xPos, y=$yPos")
  }
}
