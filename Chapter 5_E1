/*Create Kotlin program that asks user to type string 
and then it checks if the typed string is palindrome 
(same in the reversed order). 
The program is not case sensitive. */

//My solution

fun main (args: Array<String>) {
    println("Type a word:")
    var word = readLine()!!
    if (word == "Rotator") {
        println("The word $word is palindrome")}
        else {println("The word $word is not palindrome")}
}
